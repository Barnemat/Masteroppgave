There's an old mill by the stream, Nellie Dean,
Where we used to sit and dream, Nellie Dean.
And the waters as they flow
Seem to murmur sweet and low,
You're my heart's desire; I love you, Nellie Dean.

By the old mill stream I'm dreaming, Nellie Dean;
Dreaming of your bright eyes gleaming, Nellie Dean.
As they used to fondly glow
When we sat there long ago
Listening to the waters flow, Nellie Dean.

I can hear the robins singing, Nellie Dean;
Sweetest recollections bringing, Nellie Dean.
And they seem to sing of you
With your tender eyes of blue,
For I know they miss you too, Nellie Dean.

There's an old mill by the stream, Nellie Dean,
Where we used to sit and dream, Nellie Dean.
And the waters as they flow
Seem to murmur sweet and low,
You're my heart's desire; I love you, Nellie Dean.

I recall the day we parted, Nellie Dean;
How you trembled broken hearted, Nellie Dean.
And you pinned a rose of red
On my coat of blue and said
That a soldier boy you'd wed, Nellie Dean.

All the world seems sad and lonely, Nellie Dean;
For I love you and you only, Nellie Dean.
And I wonder if on high
You still love me, if you sigh
For the happy days gone by, Nellie Dean.
