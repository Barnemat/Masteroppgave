I remember one September, on a Friday night:
Stack O' Lee and Billy Lyons had a great fight.
Crying when you lose your money, learn to lose

Billy Lyons shot six-bit, Stack O' Lee bet he'd pass.
Stack O' Lee out with his .45, said You done shot your last.
When you lose your money, learn to lose

Lord a woman come a-running, fell down on her knees.
Crying O Mr. Stack O' Lee don't shoot my brother please.
When you lose your money learn to lose

I ain't talking 'bout some gambler, going to see Richard Lee.
Shot one thousand dollars and come out on a three.
Crying when you lose your money learn to lose

Lord the judge told the sheriff, We want him dead or alive.
How in the world, can we bring when he totes a .45?
When you lose your money, learn to lose

Lord a woman told the judge, My husband's name Jack Shelf.
Won't arrest poor Stack O' Lee better go somewhere else.
When you lose your money, learn to lose
